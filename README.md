# Text-Sender
Send MMS messages with Python to Verizon Wireless numbers

Note: For my use case I don't need to message other carriers if you found this and want to swipe the code for your own purposes and don't use Verizon visit this site
https://www.smscomparison.com/gateway/email-to-sms/
and change the sms_gateway_end to whatever carrier you want to send to. Just be aware SMS does not include pictures and attachments whereas MMS does.

To use this code you need to have your sensitive data in a text file set up exactly like this
Email
Email_Password
Number_To_Text

If you are using a Gmail account you will need to set up an app password which you will use instead of your actual Email_Password
